# Boolean-Function-using-VHDL
VHDL program for y = a'b' + b'c' + a'c' 
VHDL code was synthesized in Altera Quartus and Simulated in Modelsim
The netlist generated after synthesis is shown in Netlist.pdf file and the simulation result for different combination of output is shown in Simulation.pdf file.
Bo_Function_tb.vhdl file is a testbench code to check the correctness of the Boolean Function
Testbench simulation.pdf file is a simulation result of the testbench file
